# Platformer
Platformer v1
- use the level editor2.py file to make/create a level and if not, there's already generated level in maps.txt
- once/if level is made close out of the .py file to save changes to the maps.txt file
- run the main.py file and the level should be there. 
- If you run these in Atom an error will pop up regarding the images/file imports because of the way directories are handled in atom, so you'll have to edit the code and anywhere you see pygame.image.load you'll need to insert the absolute path of wherever the files for this 'platformer' are saved. It should run fine in any other IDE ie (well so far, Python IDE, sublime, VS and pycharm seem to be working fine on my end)
- put all images in a folder called 'images'
- and maps.txt in a folder called maps (yh ik its bad name choices :/ )
