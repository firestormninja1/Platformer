# Platformer
Platformer v1
- use the level editor2.py file to make/create a level and if not, there's already generated level in maps.txt
- once/if level is made close out of the .py file to save changes to the maps.txt file
- run the main.py file and the level should be there. 
- If you run these in Atom it'll mess up because of the way directory are handled, so you'll have to edit the code and anywhere you see pygame.image.load you'll need to insert the absolute path of wherever the files for this 'platformer' are saved.
